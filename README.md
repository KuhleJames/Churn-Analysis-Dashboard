# Project Overview
## Executive Summary
The telecommunications company is experiencing significant customer churn, particularly among month-to-month contract holders, fiber optic internet users, and customers using manual payment methods. Existing churn reports are static, spreadsheet-based, and lack clarity on the root causes of churn.

This project presents a comprehensive, end-to-end churn analysis solution using Excel, PostgreSQL, and Power BI. By analysing customer behaviours and service usage patterns, we uncover key churn drivers and build an interactive dashboard to help the Customer Success Leadership Team make informed decisions and target high-risk customer segments more effectively.
